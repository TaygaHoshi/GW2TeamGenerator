## GW2TeamGenerator
 Creates sPvP teams of any size, given a template and the ranked rating and roles of players. The main purpose of GW2TG is helping sPvP guilds create events (like in-houses and tournaments) easily while being fair to all players. GW2TG **doesn't** take build strength into consideration as that would be impossible.

 Plans for the future:
 * Support CSV files exported from Google Forms.
 * GUI
