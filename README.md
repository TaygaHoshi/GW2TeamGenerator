## GW2TeamGenerator
 Creates sPvP teams of any size, given a template, their ranked ratings and the roles they play. The main purpose of GW2TG is helping sPvP guilds create events (like in-houses and tournaments) easily while being fair to all players. GW2TG **doesn't** take build strength into consideration as that would be impossible.

 Plans for the future:
 * Improve team creation by biasing against class stacking 

## How to use
 Use a form with exactly the same layout as [Sample form style](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUDl_ECvYax1dhXi13cHridjF3wl4U2-fbC9Iq4fAWXI0wUw/viewform) and after players fill it, send it to Google Sheets. Then, export it as a *tab-seperated values file (.tsv)*. After that, change the name of the file to *players.tsv* and put it next to the .exe file. Current version lacks a GUI, and it will try to read a *players.tsv* from the .exe's directory. Then it will save the results in *output.txt*.
